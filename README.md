# Python_Django Rest API Application

### Technologies

- Python | Django 2.2 | Django REST Framework 3.9 | Vagrant | VirtualBox | ModHeaders
- Deploy dev server to AWS

### Development Server

#### Vagrant

1. Allows us to describe the type of server needed for an app
1. Save the configuration as a Vagrant file for ease of reproducing and sharing w/ other devs
1. Vagrant uses Virtualbox (a Hypervisor) (by Oracle) to create a Virtual Server as we described; our code and requiremwnts will run here,
   isolated from our local machine - We can run the same software as a true production server here as well!
1. We can wasily create and destroy the server as we see fit

### Application Code

#### Python, Django, & Django REST Framework

1. Python, a coding language, is the 1st layer and serves logic for the app
1. Django, a web framework for Python, is the 2nd layer. It standardizes apps and has a pre-defined set of code to perform common actions
1. Django REST Framework, provides a set of features for making standard REST APIs

### Tools

#### IDE, Git, ModHeaders

- ModHeaders is a Chrome Extension for easily modifying HTTP Headers when testing an API

### Set Up Dependencies

1. Install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (OS X hosts)
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) (MAC OS X); Check In terminal with `vagrant --version` to See something like `Vagrant 2.2.14`
1. Install [ModHeader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en)
1. `git init, touch readme, .gitignore`. Here's a standard `.gitignore` for a python vagrant project: [gitignore](https://gist.github.com/LondonAppDev/dd166e24f69db4404102161df02a63ff)
1. Create License File: [License File](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) - to make it clear to others what they can do with this code if they were to reuse it, and to protect yourself from a lawsuit.
1. `git add .`, `git commit -am'first commit'`

#### SSH Key

1. âžœ `ls ~/.ssh` Generate an SSH Key: `ssh-keygen -t rsa 4096 -C "lelandshir@gmail.com"`: this runs the SSH Key Generation Tool. The command says "Create a new key that is an RSA type, is 4,096 bytes, with a comment so that you can ID what the key is for if you need to. Press enter to generate the key/pair, and enter again to save it in it's default path (recommended). Create a passphrase for the key as an extra layer of security against web crawlers. They can't use the key w/o a passphrase if they do steal it.
1. `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to grab key and head to gitHub to add it.
1. Create a new repo on github, and `git remote add origin <url>` to configure path, then `git branch -M main` to configure a `main` branch, then `git push -u origin main`

### Create A Vagrant File

- `vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64` : init project w/ new vagrant file and bases it on ubuntu/bionic64 base image, [Vagrantfile](https://gist.github.com/LondonAppDev/199eef145a21587ea866b69d40d28682)
